    The<br>
    centralization of information also worries me <br>
    because it makes it easier for things to disappear. After my <br>
    arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn’t able to pay <br>
    its monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a database on my own <br>
    web server. (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives<br>
     to your own web space, whereas now most platforms don’t let you so.)Even if I didn’t, the Internet<br>
     archive might keep a copy. But what if my account on Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason?<br>
     Those services themselves may not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day many<br>
     American services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current regime of sanctions.<br>
     If that happened, I might be able to download my posts in some of them, and let’s assume the backup can be easily <br>
    imported into another platform.But what about the unique web address for my social network profile? Would I be able <br>
    to claim it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but managing the process <br>
    is easier and more clear— especially since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which makes it less <br>
    prone to sudden and untransparent decisions.But the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social <br>
    networks is something else: It is making us all much less powerful in relation to governments and corporations.Surveillance <br>
    is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time goes by. The only way to stay outside of this vast <br>
    apparatus of surveillance might be to go into a cave and sleep, even if you can’t make it 300 years.Being watched is something <br>
    we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically <br>
    enough, states that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than those, like Iran, <br>where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal access to social media companies.What is more <br>
    frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. When Facebook can know us better than our <br>
    parents with only 150 likes, and better than our spouses with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both <br>
    for governments and for businesses. And predictability means control.Middle-class Iranians, like most people <br>
    in the world, are obsessed with new trends. Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their <br>
    trendiness. In early 2000s writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook <br>
    came in and then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows <br>what is next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even <br>
    all my concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried <br>
    about the wrong thing. Maybe it’s not the death of the <br>
    hyperlink, or the centralization,
    <br>exactly.<br>
