  <p class="Start">Dear my friends,</p>
  <p class="Middle">The centralization of information also worries me because it makes it easier for things to<br> disappear. After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because I wasn’t able to pay<br> its monthly fee. But at least I had
    a backup of all my posts in a database on my own web server.<br> (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to transfer your posts and archives to your own<br> web space, whereas now most platforms don’t let you so.)<br>
    Even if I didn’t, the Internet archive might keep a copy. But what if my account on Facebook<br> or Twitter is shut down for any reason? Those services themselves may not die any time soon, but<br> it would be not too difficult to imagine a day
    many American services shut down accounts<br> of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the current regime of sanctions. If that happened, I might<br> be able to download my posts in some of them, and let’s assume the backup can be easily<br>
    imported into another platform.<br>
    But what about the unique web address for my social network profile? Would I be able to claim<br>it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names switch hands, too, but<br> managing the process is easier and more clear—
    especially since there is a financial relationship <br>between you and the seller which makes it less prone to sudden and untransparent decisions.<br>
    But the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social networks<br> is something else: It is making us all much less powerful in relation to governments and <br>corporations.<br>
    Surveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time goes by. The<br> only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be to go into a cave and<br> sleep, even if you can’t make it 300
    years.<br>
    Being watched is something we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, sadly, it<br> has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically enough, states that cooperate <br>with Facebook and Twitter know much more about
    their citizens than those, like Iran, where the <br>state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have legal access to social media companies.<br>
    What is more frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. When<br> Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes, and better than our spouses<br> with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both
    for governments and for businesses. <br>And predictability means control.<br>
    Middle-class Iranians, like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends. Utility or<br> quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s writing blogs made <br>you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook
    came in and then Twitter. Since 2014 the<br> hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is next. But the more I think about these changes, <br>the more I realize that even all my concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am
    worried<br> about the wrong thing. Maybe it’s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization,<br> exactly.<br><br><br>
  </p>

  <p class="End">yours,<br>Hossein Derakhshan</p>
