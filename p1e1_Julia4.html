  <p>The centralization of information also worries me because it makes it easier for <br>things to disappear. After my arrest, my hosting service closed my account, because <br>I wasn’t able to pay its monthly fee. But at least I had a backup of all my posts in a <br>database on my own web server. (Most blogging platforms used to enable you to <br>transfer your posts and archives to your own web space, whereas now most <br>platforms don’t let you so.)</p>
 <p>Even if I didn’t, the Internet archive might keep a copy. But what if my account on <br>Facebook or Twitter is shut down for any reason? Those services themselves may <br>not die any time soon, but it would be not too difficult to imagine a day many <br>American services shut down accounts of anyone who is from Iran, as a result of the <br>current regime of sanctions. If that happened, I might be able to download my posts <br>in some of them, and let’s assume the backup can be easily imported into another <br>platform.</p>
  <p>But what about the unique web address for my social network profile? Would I be <br>able to claim it back later, after somebody else has possessed it? Domain names <br>switch hands, too, but managing the process is easier and more clear— especially <br>since there is a financial relationship between you and the seller which makes it less <br>prone to sudden and untransparent decisions.</p>
  <p>But the scariest outcome of the centralization of information in the age of social <br>networks is something else: It is making us all much less powerful in relation to <br>governments and corporations.</p>
 <p>Surveillance is increasingly imposed on civilized lives, and it just gets worse as time <br>goes by. The only way to stay outside of this vast apparatus of surveillance might be <br>to go into a cave and sleep, even if you can’t make it 300 years.</p>
 <p>Being watched is something we all eventually have to get used to and live with and, <br>sadly, it has nothing to do with the country of our residence. Ironically enough, states <br>that cooperate with Facebook and Twitter know much more about their citizens than <br>those, like Iran, where the state has a tight grip on the Internet but does not have <br>legal access to social media companies.</p>
 <p>What is more frightening than being merely watched, though, is being controlled. <br>When Facebook can know us better than our parents with only 150 likes, and better <br>than our spouses with 300 likes, the world appears quite predictable, both for <br>governments and for businesses. And predictability means control.</p>
 <p>Middle-class Iranians, like most people in the world, are obsessed with new trends. <br>Utility or quality of things usually comes second to their trendiness. In early 2000s <br>writing blogs made you cool and trendy, then around 2008 Facebook came in and <br>then Twitter. Since 2014 the hype is all about Instagram, and no one knows what is <br>next. But the more I think about these changes, the more I realize that even all my <br>concerns might have been misdirected. Perhaps I am worried about the wrong thing. <br>Maybe it’s not the death of the hyperlink, or the centralization, exactly.</p>
